This project is a personal portfolio website that I created using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The website showcases my skills, projects, and work experience in a visually appealing and user-friendly way. With Next.js, I was able to build a fast, server-side rendered website that provides a seamless user experience. And with Tailwind CSS, I was able to quickly and easily style my website with a modern and responsive design.
